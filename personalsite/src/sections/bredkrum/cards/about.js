					bredkrum solves lost and found by leveraging tools and resources which
					are available to everyone. The resulting solution ensuring the item is
					returned through an intuitive, barrier-free, and secure communication
					platform. Because the problem isn't that you lost it, but someone
					found it, and can't communicate with you. <br /> <br />
					As a solo founder, I focused on validating ideas through creative lean
					social experiments and building a stable and scalable foundation for
					the business to grow. I gained a new understanding of the "why" behind
					business decisions while continually improving my process. <br />
					<br /> Falling in a unique space as a software company with a
					necessary physical product, I enjoyed manifesting my ideas physically
					in my hands. These experiences taught me first hand how to make a
					vision real. Tackling business challenges unique to manufacturing,
					intellectual property, financial strategy, software development, and
					go to market strategy. bredkrum currently supports ~50 users tracking
					~150 individual items.
					<br /> <br />
					bredkrum uses dynamically generated unique QR codes as in-person
					authentication and triggers SMS messages from the finder to the owner.
					Leveraging Progressive Web App design and serverless architecture,
					bredkrum provides an app-less user experience with everything living
					within the devices' default browser. bredkrum is built using React to
					ensure predictable and reliable user experience for all devices
					anywhere in the world.
